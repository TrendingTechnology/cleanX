# How Can You Contribute?

## Reporting Bugs: 
Use the issues tab.

## Suggesting Enhancements: 
Check around to make sure no other package already has
similar code to what you want. If there is no other package, add it to the issues
and we will do our best to eventually built it if it is within our scope.

## Code Contributions: 
Fork and drop me an email (doctormakeda@gmail.com) 

## Urgent Developer/Code Contributions: 
We would especially love to continue to add to the command line interface,
and make use of it to make a code free PACS plug-in for open source PACS systems.
If you add a module to extend this into any open source PACS system e.g.
Dicoogle or Othanc, please keep us updated on any progress!  

## Urgent Non-Developer/No Code Contributions: 
We continue to add documentation for professionals who are not primarily programmers.
If you want to contribute to helping us understand the needs of people who do not
want to code a lot, but do want to develop AI for chest X-rays drop me an email 
(doctormakeda@gmail.com).
